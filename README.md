This is an experimental program

It simply let you filter the missions between the game, the monster, the place and the dificulty. Then it searches in the database
the missions that fit those parameters and pick a random one.
You can use it when you don't know what to hunt principally.

The 4 Ultimate, Generations Ultimate and 3 Ultimate are the only that work.

The databases of 4U and GU are from the Gathering Hall Studios. The 3U database are from MonsterHunter3UDatabase repository. The images are from there also.
