This is an experimental program

It simply let you filter the missions between the game, the monster, the place and the dificulty. Then it searches in the "database"
the missions that fit those parameters and pick a random one.
You can use it when you don't know what to hunt principally.

The 4 Ultimate and Generations Ultimate are the only that work.
